## By Shankaron Mohamed 

## Description üíÅ üìñ
This project is a web application for a coffee shop that sells coffee beans in 1-pound servings, each stored in large burlap sacks. The application focuses on CREATE, READ, and UPDATE functionality, with the option to implement DELETE functionality. Here are the key features and user stories:

1. List/Menu of Coffee Beans:

- Users can view a list/menu displaying various types of coffee beans.
- For each coffee bean, users can see details such as name, origin, price, and roast level (light, medium, or dark).

2. Add New Burlap Sack:

- Users can submit a form to add a new burlap sack of coffee to the shop's inventory.
- The new sack is added with an initial quantity of 130 pounds of coffee beans.

3. View Burlap Sack Details:
- Users can click on a burlap sack to view its detail page.
The detail page displays the remaining pounds of coffee beans in the sack.

4. Sell Coffee Beans:
-Users can click a button to sell a pound of coffee beans from a sack.
The application ensures that the quantity of coffee beans in a sack does not go below 0.

By implementing these features, the application provides an intuitive interface for managing and selling coffee beans stored in burlap sacks, making it easy for users to interact with the coffee shop's inventory.
